# Genetic Circuits Simulation for DPAHelix project

This repository corresponds to one of the five computational biology analyses of the DPAHelix project in the GOGEC Competition of 2026.

> **Objective**: Simulate the behavior of genetic circuits in engineered _B. subtilis_.

We worked our model using notebooks from Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/). Important updates to our code were later added to this repository.
